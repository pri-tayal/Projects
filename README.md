PWC-PowerBI-Project
As part of the PWC Virtual Program on Forage, I successfully completed a project consisting of three key tasks, each involving the use of Power BI for data analysis and visualization:

Call Centre Trends - Visualising Customer and Agent Behavior
I created a comprehensive dashboard in Power BI, utilizing the provided raw datasets to reflect key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics that illustrate customer and agent behavior trends.

Customer Retention - Customer Demographics and Insights
I defined and tracked appropriate KPIs related to customer retention. Additionally, I developed a dashboard for the retention manager and conducted a detailed churn analysis.

Diversity & Inclusion - Gender Balance in the Executive Suite
I identified and defined relevant KPIs in areas such as hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover. I then visualized these insights through dashboards to provide a clear overview of gender balance within the executive suite.
